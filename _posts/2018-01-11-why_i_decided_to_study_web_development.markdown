I attended Western Kentucky University for a little over two years. I could never decide what major I wanted to pursue so I just took a class on each subject that I thought interested me. One of those subjects was Computer Information Technology. The reason I thought it would interest me is because I have always enjoyed reading about and playing with computers and gadgets. I always wondered how things work when you visit a website or play a game. After completing the Tic Tac Toe game I would have never thought that much coding went into such a simple game. So back to my story, I took two classes in CIT and absolutely loved it. It made me think it such a different way. Sadly something happened to where I could not attend WKU anymore and I was devastated. I was just so mad and depressed that I just took a break for a while just to think my life out. Recently I decided that I needed to finish some kind of CIT program or web development program since that is what I truly enjoy. When I found out about Flatiron I did lots of research and couldn't find a negative review. So I took the bootcamp prep course and reminded me of how much I enjoy doing this. After a couple weeks I decided to put in an application to join Flatiron and become a member and I was accepted. I just love Flatiron and how helpful everyone is if your stuck on something. I am glad to be a part of such a friendly community.
