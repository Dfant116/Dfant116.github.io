Before I started this program I had just a little understanding of what coding was. I took a couple classes at a university I went to. As it was just a beginners course we didn’t really do much complicated programming. So as I am doing these lessons and the labs on Learn it’s a big surprise on how complicated it can get. When I am programming it makes me think in a totally different way. It's almost like I have to switch on a different part of my brain I have never used before when I was in other subjects. So far my favorite type has to be front-end programming. I definitely like HTML and CSS better than Ruby. I like all the different ways you can design a webpage and seeing what you have created. So if you plan to start learning to code and want it to be your career I suggest you do it every single day even if it's just an hour. If you skip a couple of days and you just learned a new type of looping or iteration you will most likely have to go back and learn it all over again. Just make sure to keep it consistent.
