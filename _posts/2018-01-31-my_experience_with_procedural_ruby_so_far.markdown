I have a love/hate relationship with using Ruby language. The reason I say that is because I love the simplicity of the language and how you can make it easily readable, but sometimes I just can't wrap my head around how to tie it all in (if that makes sense). I think the reason I sometimes can't create the right #method or input the right variables is because I just overthink and expect it to be some crazy long method. But in reality it's simple if you approach in the proper way. I think if you can remember and understand all the ways to write a #method then you will be successful in Ruby.

Some advice for people who are just starting to learn about this amazing programming language. Whenever you finish a section, like the Intro to Arrays as an example, stay on that section until you really understand the coding and what it is actually doing. Because I think some people, like me, get frustrated on a certain section and they just want to get it over with and move on to the next. Well if you do that then it will mess up your learning experience in the future. You'll see a part of the code in a lab that you donâ€™t understand and you'll have to go all the way back and find what you missed. 

So there is my little update on my Procedural Ruby learning experience and just a little bit of advice for someone that is just starting with this program.
